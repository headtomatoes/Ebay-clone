We learned a lot about the Web Application Development Process from the development process of the Egay Website. Although the proof of concept version is finished, there are still a few things we can do to enhance the functionality and performance of the website. To start, the effectiveness of the Egay Website in e-commerce could really benefit from adding a product recommendation engine. This feature would recommend items based on what customers have bought or looked at before, making it easier for them to shop and potentially increasing sales. Secondly, the current system runs as a demo on a local host, which means it can only handle single-user sessions. To reach its full potential in a real-world setting, it's crucial to move the Egay Website to a production environment that can effectively manage multiple users at the same time. Finally, for the Egay Website to work effectively as a complete e-commerce platform, it's really important to integrate secure payment gateways. This would give both customers and administrators strong tools for smooth and safe online transactions.
The Egay Website project has been a really great opportunity for learning, beyond just its practical features. Our skills in coding and managing source code for complicated projects have greatly improved. This fundamental skill is really important for making sure things can be kept up over time and for helping with future projects. Additionally, the project helped us improve our skills in analyzing system requirements in detail and turning them into effective strategies for implementation before starting development. Working on a system of this size really helped us improve our communication and teamwork skills. This created a space where everyone could share their ideas easily, resulting in better solutions and a stronger team vibe.
Overall, the Egay Website project was a great chance to use what we've learned in class in a real-world situation. It helped us get a lot of practical experience and develop important technical and soft skills during the whole development process.
